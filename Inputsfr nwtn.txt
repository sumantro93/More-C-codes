Newton's Forward Interpolation Formulae Implementation.


Input:

Provide X Values at first and then Y Values
Then Specify the X Value for which Y Value is to be calculated.


Output:

The value of Y as calculated by using the Newton's Forward Interpolation Formulae.

The Values of Y,dy,d2y, ..... are stored in a two diamensional matrix.

The 0th row of all columns are filled first and if there is futhur values for a column the consecutive cells in that column is filled.

i.e,

y     	  dy      	d2y    	

x1    x11 = x2-x1	x12-x11

x2    x12 = x3-x2

x3
